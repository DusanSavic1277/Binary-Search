# Binary Search in Java

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the Binary Search algorithm in Java.

## Project Description

The program:
- Creates an array with 100 elements
- Fills the array with numbers from `0` to `99`
- Searches for a target value using the **Binary Search** algorithm
- Prints the index of the element if found, or a message if it is not found

Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm that works only on **sorted arrays** and has a time complexity of O(log n).

## How Binary Search Works

1. Set the starting (`low`) and ending (`high`) indices  
2. Find the middle element  
3. Compare the middle element with the target value  
4. Continue searching in the appropriate half of the array  

## Time Complexity

- **Best case:** O(1)  
- **Average case:** O(log n)  
- **Worst case:** O(log n)
